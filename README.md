# BeatFlow

<strong>BeatFlow</strong> is a dynamic music game built in Swift using the powerful SpriteKit library. Fusing elements inspired by hits like Piano Tiles and Beat Saber, BeatFlow invites players to immerse themselves in a rhythmic adventure where the main task is to cut musical notes that flow across the screen to the beat of the music.
